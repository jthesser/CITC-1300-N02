            <h2>  About a Type 1 Diabetic:</h2>
            <h3>We are the same as you, we just need an occasional extra break so we can tell our dead pancreas to move out of the way and let us manually do its job!</h3>
            <p>As a Type 1 diabetic, we are no different than you except that our pancreas no longer does its job and instead manual intervention is required.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>We must stop to occasionally check our sugar, or eat a snack - especially when performing strenuous activites. </li>
                <li>We might feel sluggish or slow, when our sugar is high, and therefore may need to drink lots of water or stay active while often checking and correcting our insulin dosages</li>
                <li>We might feel consfused or light-headed when our sugar is low. Just let us sit down and drink a little orange juice and we will usually be ok. <br>
                    If blood sugar is 40 or lower we may need emergency assistance but normally we can feel our blood sugar lows before that happens. </li>
                <li>There is usually no reason to panic or call 911. We just need 15-20 minutes for carbohydrates or insulin to start moving through our body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <h2>One day we hope for a cure.<br>
            Until that day, we ask for understanding and patience in our daily lives as we battle daily to stay healthy and alive. </h2>
