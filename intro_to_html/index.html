            <h1>What is Type 1 Diabetes?</h1>
            <p> An autoimmune disease, currently treatable, but still without a cure.
                (the body attacks itself by mistake). This reaction destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin.
                <br>Normally diagnosed as a teenager or early in life.
                The pancreas does not make enough insulin or very little insulin.
                Diet and exercise are important but only insulin can help regulate blood sugars.
