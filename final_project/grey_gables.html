          <p>Mia loves to go for car rides. She knows when it is "Saturday" and we are home together as a family. She loves our cat Kola and doesn't harm anything except flies.... she hates anything that flys!</p>

        <a href="images/MiaRide.jpg"><img src="images/MiaRide.jpg" alt="Mia photo"></a> 
        <p>One of Mia's favorite places to visit is Catoosa Wildlife Management area. She loves the creeks, and seeing animals as we drive around aimlessly. She knows the words "deer", "turkey" and often detects the animals before we even see them.</p>

        <p>This is about as wet as Mia enjoys to get. I thought labs loved water! She likes to get her paws wet but if it touches her stomach, she's done! She does like to explore with us and is very well behaved. If it's just us we sometimes let her off the leash but not often. </p>
