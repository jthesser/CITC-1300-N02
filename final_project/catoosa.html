    <p>One of my all time favorite places to go is Catoosa Wildlife Management Area on Genesis Road, Crossville TN.
        This is a public area, free to roam during the day. The main roads are gravel and most are easy to travel in a 2WD vehicle.
        Back roads require an off terain vehicle. I have seen many wildlife varities of birds and other animals such as Deer, Coyotes, Rattlesnakes, turkeys, and even a bear once.
    What is known as the <i>Devil's Breakfast Table area</i> is a nice swimming area that is fairly secluded. The main way to access it is now through Wartburg entrance since the bridge is closed off Otter creek through Genesis Road.
