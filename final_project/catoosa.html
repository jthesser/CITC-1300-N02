  <h1>Hidden Gems in Tennessee</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>We live in such a diverse world and no matter who you meet, or where you're at, you will never meet another person or be in that exact moment of time again.
    Enjoy the moments while you have them and take photos to remember them for years to come! Some people enjoy video games, watching Netflix, or making websites. I enjoy travelling with my wife of 20 years, Melissa, and our rescue "road dog", Mia. 
    This website is my personal opinion of some <i>hidden gems</i> that you may not know about in Tennessee that have stolen our heart.
    When traveling in these areas, it is well worth the stop. Even if you cannot stay the night in the Inn, or get a table at the Burro, it is just as much fun to simply experience the environment.</h2>
