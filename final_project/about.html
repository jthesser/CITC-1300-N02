  <h1>Meet our "Road Dog" Mia!</h1>
  <p>Mia found us about 7 years ago. My wife and I were venturing in some back woods and she walked upon us as a 10 month old puppy. Someone had dropped her off. She was starving so bad you could see all of her ribs, full of ticks and scared. It took some coaxing, but we got her close enough to give her food and water. We couldn't leave her, so we brought her home. Now she is a happy and healthy dog with a loving home. She enjoys going for rides and knows how to sit, shake, and high five. She shows her love to us daily and we would not be complete without her.

          <p>Mia loves to go for car rides. She knows when it is "Saturday" and we are home together as a family. She loves our cat Kola and doesn't harm anything except flies.... she hates anything that flys!</p>

        <p>One of Mia's favorite places to visit is Catoosa Wildlife Management area. She loves the creeks, and seeing animals as we drive around aimlessly. She knows the words "deer", "turkey" and often detects the animals before we even see them.</p>

        <p>This is about as wet as Mia enjoys to get. I thought labs loved water! She likes to get her paws wet but if it touches her stomach, she's done! She does like to explore with us and is very well behaved. If it's just us we sometimes let her off the leash but not often. </p>
