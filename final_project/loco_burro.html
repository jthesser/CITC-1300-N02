    <h2>Loco Burro Restaurant - Gatlinburg Tennessee</h2>

    <p>When visiting downtown Gatlinburg strip, I highly recommend dinner at Loco Burro's restaurant. 
        Stop at the glisting lights on the sidewalk and ride the magical escalator to the middle floor of the restaurant. 
        You will be greated by a host and pass by a mechanical donkey that usually attracts several "over endulged" adults and lots of good laughs.
        If you ask the waiter/waitress nicely to go up to the roof level, there is a top patio with gas powered, glass fireplaces, and couches, chairs that overlook the Gatlinburg main strip. 
        Patio may be closed during cold or severe weather.
        You can enjoy a nice beverage or scrumptious food, while secretly watching and making fun of the tourists below!
        The <a href="https://locoburrocantina.com/wp-content/uploads/Loco-GB-Menu-12-6-22-WEB.pdf" target="_blank"> food menu </a> is amazing! I personally love the 6 layer Dip with their amazingly thin chips and salsa.
