            <p>A Healthy Diet is different for each person due to different body types, and depends on many other health variables such as food allergies, dietary restrictions or intolerances.
                However, generally speaking, a healthy diet is described as a one plate meal containing low carb foods such as protein, lots of greens, vegetables, and natural fruits.
                Some sources of carbohydrates, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans, are healthier than others. 
                For example, sweet potatoes and small red potatoes are healthier than white potatoes. Green beans are lower carb than corn or sweet peas.
                Of course choosing an apple would be much healthier than 1/2 of a Twix candy bar.
                For diabetic meal planning, 1 carb serving is about 15 grams of carbs. 
                For my specific body weight and height, I was recommended to eat around 45-60 grams of carbs per meal.
                Breakfast is the most important meal of the day with the higher carb count.
                Lunch and dinner, I try to eat lighter to not feel sluggish and tired while food is digesting.

            <p>To <b>stay healthy</b> we should all try to <b>choose healthy </b> foods in our diet.
            A balanced meal should contain many sources of vitamins, nutrients and protein. 
            A Twix candy bar, for example, has 34 grams of carbohydrates... that is almost a whole meal for me personally! No way!
            A full dinner plate, with salad, steak, baked potato and condiments would be about the same amount of carbohydrates.
            Therefore, it all depends on healthy food choices!

            <p>Fresh fruits and vegetables are highly recommended with every meal. Yes, fruits have sugar, but it is <i>natural</i> sugars that your body craves. 
                Eating is all about <i>portion control.</i>
            A small portion of each food group on the <a href="images/foodpyramid.jpg" target="blank">Food Pyramid</a> is really all you need to stay fit.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Sweets and Desserts should be avoided or taken in moderation. I personally hate when someone says that I can't have something sweet <i>because I'm diabetic</i>. or 
                when someone says <i>"You shouldn't have that, should you?"</i> it takes everything for me not to say <i>"You shouldn't have that either buddy!"</i></i>Sweets are good for the soul, according to some research.</p>
