            <h1> What is considered a "healthy food"?</h2>
            <h2>A Healthy Diet is different for each person due to different body types, and depends on many other health variables such as food allergies, dietary restrictions or intolerances. </h3>
            <p>Click the plate below for more information on how to eat healthy.<br>
                The majority of your plate should consist of vegetables, meat, fruits and grains. <br>
                Sugars and Sweets should be very limited.

            <p>As a healthy <i>human</i> we all should <u>try</u> to <i>choose</i> healthy foods in our daily diet <i>choices</i>.
            A Twix candy bar, for example, has 34 grams of carbohydrates... that is almost a whole meal!
            A full dinner plate, with salad, steak, baked potato and condiments would be about the same amount of carbohydrates.
            It all depends on YOU making healthy food choices and using portion control!
            I recommend to start with smaller portions on your plate and then going back for second helpings only if you really feel the need. 
            You will be surprised on how you can become full on smaller portions by simply not overfilling your plate.

            <p>A full dinner plate balanced with protein, fruits, vegetables, and grains is much more satisfying and healthy than processed foods.
                Eating fish, just one or two times a week, has proven enough to gain the nutritional benefits found in the fish.
                Fish is a low calorie, high protein food. It is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which also help promote brain growth and development.
                Omega-3s have been known to decrease the risk of heart disease and decrease inflammation.
                Fish are high in Vitamin D and other important nutrients and eating fish has been linked to reduce the risk of Type 1 diabetes!
                NOTE: There are some fish that are not meant to be eaten due to high levels of mercury. See <a href="https://www.epa.gov/choose-fish-and-shellfish-wisely/fish-and-shellfish-advisories-and-safe-eating-guidelines" target="blank">EPA.GOV Article</a> for more information.

            </ul>
            <p>Salads with lots of color and vegetables are a healthy choice with many vitamins and nutrients.
                Add proteins such as chicken or ham as well as a delicious dressing and maybe even some fruit, for a delicious and healthy full meal! Fresh fruits and vegetables are highly recommended. The majority of your plate should consist of fresh fruit, colorfull vegetables and mixed protein
