            <h1> What is considered a "healthy food"?</h2>
            <h2>A Healthy Diet is different for each person due to different body types, and depends on many other health variables such as food allergies, dietary restrictions or intolerances. </h3>
            <p>Click the plate below for more information on how to eat healthy.<br>
                The majority of your plate should consist of vegetables, meat, fruits and grains. <br>
                Sugars and Sweets should be very limited.

            <p>As a healthy <i>human</i> we should all try to <i>choose</i> healthy foods for the majority of our diets.
            A balanced meal should contain approx 45 grams of carbohydrates per meal. 
            A Twix candy bar, for example, has 34 grams of carbohydrates... that is almost a whole meal!
            A full dinner plate, with salad, steak, baked potato and condiments would be about the same amount of carbohydrates.
            It all depends on healthy food choices!

            <p>Salads with lots of color and vegetables are a healthy choice with many vitamins and nutrients.
                Add proteins such as chicken or ham as well as a delicious dressing and maybe even some fruit, for a delicious and healthy full meal! Fresh fruits and vegetables are highly recommended. The majority of your plate should consist of fresh fruit, colorfull vegetables and mixed protein
