            <p>As a healthy <i>human</i> we should all try to <i>choose</i> healthy foods for the majority of our diets.
            Sugary breads such as donuts, muffins, pastrys and other baked sweets usually smell great and can easily tempt your taste buds in to over endulging.
            Depending on who you ask, some may say, donuts are even good for the soul!

            <p>A full dinner plate balanced with protein, fruits, vegetables, and grains is much more satisfying and healthy than processed foods.</p>

            <p>Processed foods such as Fast food and most boxed foods in stores are not healthy!
                They are often full of sodium, high in fat, and low in the vitamins and nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle.
                However cost to purchase processed foods are often much cheaper than getting food from a local farm or deli.
