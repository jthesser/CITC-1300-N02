            <p>As a healthy <i>human</i> we should all try to <i>choose</i> healthy foods for the majority of our diets.
            Sugary breads such as donuts, muffins, pastrys and other baked sweets usually smell great and can easily tempt your taste buds in to over endulging.

                A home-made dessert is still not healthy, but is usually healthier than a processed dessert from the store.
                As always, a full dinner plate balanced with protein, fruits, vegetables, and grains is much more satisfying and healthy than processed foods.</p>

            <p>Processed foods such as Fast food and most boxed foods in stores are not healthy!
                They are often full of sodium, high in fat, and low in the vitamins and nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle.
                However cost to purchase processed foods are often much cheaper than getting food from a local farm or deli.
                When you go to the grocery store, I was told to stay around the outside edges of the store and avoid the center ailes.
