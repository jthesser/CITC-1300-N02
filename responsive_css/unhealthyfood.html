            <p>As a healthy <i>human</i> we should all try to <i>choose</i> healthy foods for the majority of our diets.
            Sugary breads such as donuts, muffins, pastrys and other baked sweets usually smell great and can easily tempt your taste buds in to over endulging.
            However; depending on who you ask, some may say, <br><a href="https://omgdecadentdonuts.com/2023/07/why-donuts-are-good-for-your-soul/" target="blank">donuts are good for the soul!</a>

                A home-made dessert is still not healthy, but is usually healthier than a processed dessert from the store.
                As always, a full dinner plate balanced with protein, fruits, vegetables, and grains is much more satisfying and healthy than processed foods.</p>

            <p>Processed foods such as Fast food and most boxed foods in stores are really not healthy!
                They are often full of sodium, high in fat, and low in the vitamins and nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle.
                Low fat is usually traded for higher carb count. Sugar Free is really not sugar free. It can be very hard to eat healthy in our society.
                The cost to purchase processed foods are often much cheaper than getting healthier foods from a local farm or deli.
                When going grocery shopping, I was always told to stay around the outside edges of the store and avoid the center ailes.
